SOLR INSTALLATION AND INDEXING DATA USING DATAIMPORTHANDLER

These steps have been performed on 32 bit Ubuntu 16.04 system. We are installing solr-6.1.0
You may have to make changes to the script based on your system.

Anything marked with * is an actual Linux command which you need to run

* cd ~
* git clone https://github.com/ahdeshmukh/xpand_solr_setup.git

* wget http://apache.claz.org/lucene/solr/6.1.0/solr-6.1.0.tgz
* tar xzf solr-6.1.0.tgz solr-6.1.0/bin/install_solr_service.sh --strip-components=2
* sudo bash ./install_solr_service.sh solr-6.1.0.tgz -u amit (amit = an already existing non-root user with sudo privileges who will own the solr files. if -u is not specified the script will create a user "solr" who will own the solr files)
After you see the output of the service which says Started LSB: Controls Apache Solr as a Service, press q to get back the control of the terminal.

To confirm if install was fine and to access solr, go to http://localhost:8983/solr (if everything goes well, you should see a solr admin page)

CREATING A CORE
* cd /opt/solr
* bin/solr create -c dih1 (creates a core called dih1. You can verify by going to http://localhost:8983/solr and see dih1 core in the Core selector list). This command will create a dih1 folder in /var/solr/data.

By default solr 6.1.0 does not create schema.xml file, but creates a managed-schema file. To switch to schema.xml (which I recommend for us, as managed-schema can be for advanced users), we need to do the following
* cd ~
* cp xpand_solr_setup/schema.xml /var/solr/data/dih1/conf
* cp xpand_solr_setup/solrconfig.xml /var/solr/data/dih1/conf
* rm /var/solr/data/dih1/conf/managed-schema

DATAIMPORTHANDLER

Installing ODBC MySQL driver
* cd /opt/solr/contrib/dataimporthandler-extras/lib
* sudo wget http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.39.tar.gz (I hope this version of the driver will be compatible with your mysql version)
* sudo tar xvf mysql-connector-java-5.1.39.tar.gz
* sudo mv mysql-connector-java-5.1.39/mysql-connector-java-5.1.39-bin.jar .
* sudo rm -rf mysql-connector-java-5.1.39
* sudo rm mysql-connector-java-5.1.39.tar.gz

Enabling dataimporthandler.
* cd ~
* cp xpand_solr_setup/data-config.xml /var/solr/data/dih1/conf 
open your data-config.xml file and make changes for the mysql connections according to your host, user and password for mysql

RESTART SOLR
* sudo service solr restart

Time to start importing data from mysql. But first we will create a sample database with some data. Refer to solr.sql file I am sending along with the email. Store it in the ~ directory

* cd ~
* mysql -u root -p < xpand_solr_setup/solr.sql (Connecting as root is not recommended, it is better to connect as some other user, but for now we will just use root user).
This will create a new database solr_tutorial and a person table inside it.

Go to http://localhost:8983/solr/#/dih1/dataimport
Check Auto-Refresh status and hit Execute. If everything goes well, your records from mysql will be indexed.
Go to http://localhost:8983/solr/#/dih1/query and hit Execute Query. You should see the records that just got indexed.


SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Solr commands (make sure the current user has sudo priviliges, otherwise you will get an error)
start => sudo service solr start
stop => sudo service solr stop
restart => sudo service solr restart

By default, the service installation script will extract the distribution archive into /opt/solr. The script creates a symlink called solr in /opt.

Separate Directory for Writable Files
You should also separate writable Solr files into a different directory. By default, the installation script uses /var/solr, but you can override this location using the -d option. With this approach, the files in /opt/solr will remain untouched and all files that change while Solr is running will live under /var/solr.
